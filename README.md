# Data Analysis Softwares for Nano-Biomechanics Lab, Lehigh University (MATLAB 2012 and older)
## Optical Tweezers
Preprocess the data, following the steps:
1. Distance correction, based on pulling speed.
2. Find all (distance) peaks (maximum and minimum).
3. Split the dataset.
4. Filter useful curves with high retract forces.
5. Extract Force (unfolding/refolding/rupture), and loading rate, after force correction (based on DNA overstretching force ~65pN).

## Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM)

## Model Fitting
- Worm-Like-Chain (WLC) Model Fit
