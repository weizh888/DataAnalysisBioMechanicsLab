  Lehigh University (use MATLAB 2012 and newer versions)

## Optical Tweezers
Preprocess the data, following the steps:
1. Distance correction, based on pulling speed.
2. Find all (distance) peaks (maximum and minimum).
3. Split the dataset.
4. Filter useful curves with high retract forces.
5. Extract Force (unfolding/refolding/rupture), and loading rate, after force correction (based on DNA overstretching force ~65pN).

## Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM)
Check the Manuals.

## Model Fitting
### Worm-Like-Chain (WLC) Model

  Refer to [J. F. Marko, E. D. Siggia (1995)](http://www.physics.rockefeller.edu/siggia/Publications/1990-9_files/markoMacromol1995.pdf).

### Bell-Evans Model

  Predicts the **linear relationship** between *force* and *log(loading-rate)*.

  Refer to [Bell GI. (1978)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/347575) and [E. Evans and K. Ritchie. (1997)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1184350/).

### Dudko Model

  Refer to [O. K. Dudko, G. Hummer, and A. Szabo. (2006)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16605793).
